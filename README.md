# wandb
 Weight and Biases 
Description
This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models to classify URLs. The dataset used includes various features extracted from URLs and a target label indicating whether the URL is malicious or benign. The models trained include Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers. The results and metrics are logged using Weights and Biases (wandb).

Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Google Colab (optional, for running the notebook)
GitHub account
Weights and Biases account
Installation
Clone the repository:


Open the notebook in Colab.
Save a copy in your own drive.
Follow the instructions to clone your GitHub repository and save the notebook back to GitHub or as a Gist.
Data Preprocessing
Load the dataset from the CSV file.
Handle missing values:
Fill missing values in features using SimpleImputer.
Remove rows with missing target values.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training
Logistic Regression
Initialize the Logistic Regression model.
Train the model using the training data.
Predict on the testing data.
Decision Tree
Initialize the Decision Tree classifier.
Train the model using the training data.
Predict on the testing data.
Model Evaluation
Evaluate the models using accuracy score.
Compare the performance of the Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.
Logging with Weights and Biases
Initialize a wandb run.
Log model metrics such as accuracy.
End the wandb run.
Results
The models are evaluated based on their accuracy in classifying the URLs. The results are logged and visualized using Weights and Biases for easy comparison and analysis.
